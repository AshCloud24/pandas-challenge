Hi, I had trouble completing the exercise in time. I have fallen behind and have been going over the previous weeks exercises, and struggling to keep up. I did my best and got as far as I could. When I got stuck on the second summary i google searched for solutions, but none of the code suggestions on the internet ended up working for me , so i didn't use them and therefore wont cite them. However, I used the starter code given, and code structures from the class exercises, and would like to know how to cite the class resources.  
I look forward to going over the solution, as I am sure part of my struggle is just tiredness and that it will take time for me to properly understand the language. I wanted to ask if we are allowed to look at online solutions, or whether we are supposed to just go back over the course material?
